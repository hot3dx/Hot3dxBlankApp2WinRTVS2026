#### Symmetry Algorithm
```cpp
// For each point, generate N symmetrical copies
θ = 2π / symmetryCount * index
x' = x * cos(θ) - y * sin(θ)
y' = x * sin(θ) + y * cos(θ)

// Optional mirror transformation
x'' = -x'
y'' = y'
```

#### Performance

- Hardware-accelerated GPU drawing
- Efficient vertex buffer updates
- Asynchronous render loop
- Minimal CPU overhead

### Build Verification
The project is configured for:
- Visual Studio 2022 (v143 toolset)
- Windows 10 SDK (10.0.17763.0+)
- x86, x64, and ARM64 architectures
- Debug and Release configurations

### Future Enhancement Potential
The architecture supports future additions:
- Undo/redo system
- Save/load functionality
- Layer support
- Custom color picker
- Export to image files
- GPU compute shaders
- Animation features
