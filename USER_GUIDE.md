# RotoDraw3D User Guide

## Getting Started

### Launching the Application
1. Launch "RotoDraw3D" from your Start Menu or Apps list
2. The application will open with a black canvas ready for drawing
3. The control panel is located at the top of the window

## Interface Overview

### Control Panel (Top Bar)
From left to right:

1. **Application Title**: "RotoDraw3D (Hot3dxSymmetry3D)"
2. **Symmetry Slider**: Controls the number of symmetry axes (1-16)
3. **Symmetry Value**: Displays current symmetry count
4. **Brush Size Slider**: Adjusts the brush stroke thickness (1-20)
5. **Clear Button**: Removes all drawings from the canvas
6. **Mirror Mode Checkbox**: Enables/disables mirror symmetry
7. **Color Buttons**: 5 preset colors to choose from

### Drawing Canvas
- The large black area below the control panel
- Touch or mouse-enabled for drawing
- Displays your symmetrical artwork in real-time

## Drawing Basics

### How to Draw
1. **Click/Touch and Drag** on the canvas to draw
2. Your strokes will be automatically mirrored based on your symmetry settings
3. Release to stop drawing
4. Click/touch and drag again to continue

### Drawing Tips
- **Slow Movements**: Create smooth, flowing lines
- **Quick Strokes**: Generate energetic, dynamic patterns
- **Circular Motions**: Produce mandala-like designs
- **Radial Strokes**: Create star or flower patterns

## Symmetry Settings

### Symmetry Count (1-16)
Controls how many times your drawing is repeated around the center:

- **1**: No symmetry, regular drawing
- **2**: Bilateral symmetry (mirror image)
- **4**: Four-fold symmetry (like a plus sign)
- **6**: Six-fold symmetry (like a snowflake)
- **8**: Eight-fold symmetry (default, creates intricate patterns)
- **12-16**: High symmetry, very dense patterns

**Use Cases**:
- **Low (1-4)**: Simple, bold designs
- **Medium (5-8)**: Balanced, aesthetic patterns
- **High (9-16)**: Complex, mandala-like art

### Mirror Mode
When enabled, each symmetry axis is mirrored:

- **Off**: Rotational symmetry only
- **On**: Both rotational and reflective symmetry (kaleidoscope effect)

**Effect**: Doubles the visual density and creates more intricate patterns

## Brush Settings

### Brush Size (1-20)
- **Small (1-5)**: Fine details, delicate lines
- **Medium (6-12)**: General drawing, balanced visibility
- **Large (13-20)**: Bold strokes, filling areas

**Tip**: Start with medium size, adjust based on your needs

### Colors
Five preset colors available:

1. **Magenta** (Purple-Pink): Vibrant and energetic
2. **Cyan** (Light Blue): Cool and calming
3. **Yellow**: Bright and cheerful
4. **Lime** (Bright Green): Fresh and lively
5. **Red**: Bold and dramatic

**Tip**: Mix colors in a single drawing for multi-colored artwork

## Techniques and Patterns

### Creating a Mandala
1. Set symmetry to 8 or 12
2. Enable Mirror Mode
3. Draw from center outward in circular motions
4. Vary colors and brush sizes for depth

### Making Flowers
1. Set symmetry to 5, 6, or 8
2. Disable Mirror Mode
3. Draw petal shapes from center outward
4. Use multiple colors for realistic effect

### Geometric Patterns
1. Set high symmetry (12-16)
2. Enable Mirror Mode
3. Draw straight lines and angles
4. Creates Islamic-art style patterns

### Abstract Art
1. Set low symmetry (2-4)
2. Toggle Mirror Mode on/off during drawing
3. Use varied brush sizes
4. Experiment freely!

### Kaleidoscope Effect
1. Set symmetry to 6 or 8
2. Enable Mirror Mode
3. Draw in the center area
4. Small movements create large effects

## Advanced Tips

### Performance
- **Large Drawings**: Clear the canvas periodically if the app slows down
- **Smooth Lines**: Draw at a consistent speed
- **Precision**: Use mouse for fine control, touch for fluid strokes

### Artistic Advice
- **Experiment**: Try different settings combinations
- **Build Gradually**: Start with simple patterns, add complexity
- **Use Negative Space**: Don't fill every area
- **Color Theory**: Complementary colors (Cyan+Red, Magenta+Lime) create contrast
- **Layering**: Draw large shapes first, add details later

### Troubleshooting

**Lines appear jagged**
- This is expected with point-based rendering
- Use smoother, slower strokes for cleaner lines

**App feels slow**
- Clear the canvas to remove accumulated points
- Restart the app for a fresh start

**Colors don't change**
- Ensure you clicked a color button
- Draw new strokes to see the color change

**Symmetry isn't visible**
- Check symmetry slider is above 1
- Draw closer to or farther from the center

## Keyboard Shortcuts
*(Not currently implemented, but suggested for future versions)*
- **Ctrl+Z**: Undo
- **Ctrl+Shift+Z**: Redo
- **Ctrl+C**: Clear canvas
- **1-5**: Select colors 1-5
